ML projects I've worked on previously

## Project 1 - Supervised Text Classification
- implemented classifiers for sentiment analysis
- analyzed features and n-gram smoothing methods

## Project 2 - Emotion Classification with Neural Networks
- implemented dnn, rnn, and cnn models to classify emotions from corpus of tweets

## Project 3 - Sequence to Sequence Language Modelling
- trained encoder-decoder model on end-to-end dataset to derive fluent sentences
- evaluated effectiveness of beam search and bleu evaluation in identifying most probable sentences

## Project 4 - Sequence Models
- implemented HMM and RNNs in order to analyse sequence data
